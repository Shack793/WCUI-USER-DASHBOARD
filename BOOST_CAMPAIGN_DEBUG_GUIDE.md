# Boost Campaign Authentication & CORS Issues - Debug Guide

## 🚨 Issues Identified

Based on the browser console logs, there are several issues preventing the boost campaign from working:

### 1. CORS Issues
```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://crowdfundingapi.wgtesthub.com/campaigns/1. (Reason: CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing). Status code: 404.
```

### 2. Authentication Issues
```
Payment methods response: { authenticated: false, methods: [...] }
```

### 3. Missing API Endpoints
```
Dashboard stats API failed: 404 - The route api/v1/dashboard/stats could not be found.
```

## ✅ Working APIs
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/boost-plans` - Returns boost plans successfully
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/payment-methods/public` - Returns payment methods (but shows authenticated: false)

## 🔧 Solutions Required

### 1. Fix CORS on Laravel Backend

Add CORS middleware to your Laravel backend. Create or update `config/cors.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    'paths' => ['api/*', 'sanctum/csrf-cookie'],
    'allowed_methods' => ['*'],
    'allowed_origins' => ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://127.0.0.1:3000', 'http://localhost:5173', 'http://127.0.0.1:5173'],
    'allowed_origins_patterns' => [],
    'allowed_headers' => ['*'],
    'exposed_headers' => [],
    'max_age' => 0,
    'supports_credentials' => true,
];
```

### 2. Install Laravel CORS Package (if not already installed)

```bash
composer require fruitcake/laravel-cors
```

### 3. Add CORS Middleware to Laravel

In `app/Http/Kernel.php`, add to the `$middleware` array:

```php
protected $middleware = [
    // ... other middleware
    \Fruitcake\Cors\HandleCors::class,
];
```

### 4. Fix Authentication Issues

The payment methods API shows `authenticated: false`. This suggests:

1. **Check if user is actually logged in** on the backend
2. **Verify JWT token is being sent correctly** in requests
3. **Check Laravel authentication middleware** on protected routes

### 5. Add Missing API Endpoints

Create the missing endpoints in your Laravel routes:

```php
// In routes/api.php
Route::middleware('auth:api')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard/stats', [DashboardController::class, 'stats']);
    Route::get('/campaigns/{id}', [CampaignController::class, 'show']);
});
```

## 🔍 Current Frontend Fixes Applied

I've added comprehensive logging and error handling to help debug:

### 1. Authentication Checks
- ✅ Added auth context integration
- ✅ Added token validation and expiry checking
- ✅ Added automatic redirect to login if not authenticated
- ✅ Added warning when payment methods API shows `authenticated: false`

### 2. Enhanced Logging
- ✅ Detailed console logs for all API calls
- ✅ Authentication status logging
- ✅ Error response logging with status codes
- ✅ API connectivity testing function

### 3. Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful fallback to mock data when APIs fail
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Toast notifications for authentication issues

### 4. Debug Features
- ✅ "Test API Connectivity" button for manual testing
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging in localStorage
- ✅ Step-by-step process logging

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix CORS on Laravel backend** (highest priority)
2. **Verify user authentication** on backend
3. **Add missing API endpoints**
4. **Test boost campaign functionality**

### Testing:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Navigate to boost campaign page
4. Click "Test API Connectivity" button
5. Check console logs for detailed error information

## 📋 Backend Checklist

- [ ] CORS middleware installed and configured
- [ ] Authentication middleware working on protected routes
- [ ] Missing API endpoints created
- [ ] JWT token validation working
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] Laravel server running on https://crowdfundingapi.wgtesthub.com

## 🔧 Quick Backend CORS Fix

If you need a quick fix for development, add this to your Laravel controller or middleware:

```php
header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization');
```

**Note**: This is for development only. Use proper CORS configuration for production.
