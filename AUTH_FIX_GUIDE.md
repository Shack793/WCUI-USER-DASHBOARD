# Authentication Fix for Page Refresh Issue

## üîç **Problem Analysis**
Users were getting logged out when refreshing the page, redirected back to login.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Improved Token Expiration Check**
- Added better JWT parsing with error handling
- Added detailed logging for token validation
- Fixed timestamp calculation (seconds vs milliseconds)

### 2. **Enhanced Authentication Context**
- Added fallback endpoint if `/api/v1/me` fails
- Better error handling - distinguish between network errors and auth errors
- More detailed logging for debugging

### 3. **Smarter Response Interceptor**
- Less aggressive redirects on 401 errors
- Only auto-redirect for specific auth endpoints
- Added delay to prevent redirect during page load

## üß™ **Testing Steps**

### Before Deployment:
1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Open browser dev tools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for authentication-related logs

2. **Test Authentication Flow**
   ```
   1. Login successfully
   2. Navigate to dashboard
   3. Refresh the page (F5)
   4. Check if user stays logged in
   ```

3. **Check Network Tab**
   - Monitor API calls to `/api/v1/me` or `/api/v1/user/profile`
   - Look for 401 errors
   - Verify Bearer token is being sent

### Console Logs to Watch For:
```
‚úÖ Good logs:
- "Token found, checking if expired..."
- "Token valid, fetching user data..."
- "User data fetched successfully:"

‚ùå Problem logs:
- "Token expired, removing token"
- "Authentication failed, removing token"
- "Both /me and /profile endpoints failed"
```

## üîß **API Endpoint Requirements**

Make sure your backend has these endpoints working:

### Primary Endpoint:
```
GET /api/v1/me
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response: { user: { id, name, email, role, phone?, country? } }
```

### Fallback Endpoint:
```
GET /api/v1/user/profile  
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response: { user: {...} } OR { id, name, email, ... }
```

## üöÄ **Deployment Instructions**

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `dist` folder** to `wgfund.wgtesthub.com`

3. **Test immediately after deployment:**
   - Login at `https://wgfund.wgtesthub.com/login`
   - Go to dashboard
   - **Refresh the page**
   - User should stay logged in

## üîç **If Still Having Issues**

### Check Backend:
1. Verify `/api/v1/me` endpoint returns user data
2. Check if JWT tokens are properly signed
3. Ensure token expiration time is reasonable (not too short)

### Check Frontend Logs:
1. Open browser console
2. Look for detailed authentication logs
3. Check Network tab for failed API calls

### Common Backend Issues:
- `/api/v1/me` endpoint doesn't exist
- JWT secret key mismatch
- Token expiration too short
- CORS issues preventing API calls

## üìù **Code Changes Summary**

1. **src/contexts/auth-context.tsx** - Better error handling & fallback endpoint
2. **src/services/authApi.ts** - Improved token expiration check with logging  
3. **src/lib/axios.ts** - Smarter 401 error handling

The authentication should now persist across page refreshes! üéâ
